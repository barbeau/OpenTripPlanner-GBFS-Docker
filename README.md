# OpenTripPlanner-GBFS-Docker

Includes all the files to run an OTP server with tampa router. I had to remove portland as it had files larger than supported by github.

When running the docker image include the parameters --server --autoScan. 
Example:
 docker run <image-name> --server --
 
 autoScan
